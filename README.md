# Generating-Music-with-Recurrent-Networks
CSE 253 homework 4


In this project, we implemented LSTM module to learn music and generate music.



# data_prep.py

There are some preparation function inside which can convert original data to one-hot vector

# input.txt

There are more than 1000 pieces of music in ABC notation, you can use http://mandolintab.net/abcconverter.php to convert ABC notation
to music sheets.

# music.py

This file contains LSTM definition, training function, test function, music generation function and heatmap function.

# music_generation.ipynb

LSTM demo

# music_sample.mid

sample music in midi format, you may listen to it

# music_sample.pdf

sample music sheet
